#Generators
'''
-->This is a special type of function that return an ITERATOR which one at a time
here we use yield instead return

#yield
-----
-->it will take a pause and again resume, this is not a normal keyword can not be used in normal functions.
-->This is used to produce a value and pause execution.

#Next()
-------
--->This is used to get next value from a generator
--->When the value is finished,it will stop the iterator
